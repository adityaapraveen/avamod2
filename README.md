# Function Frontend

This project consists of a React web application that interacts with an Ethereum smart contract using MetaMask. The Ethereum smart contract, named "Assessment," handles basic mathematical calculations and stores a balance. Users can connect their MetaMask wallets, view their account balance, and perform cube and sum of cubes calculations on the blockchain.

## Description


This project combines a React front-end and a Solidity smart contract on Ethereum, enabling users to connect their MetaMask wallets, perform mathematical calculations on the blockchain, and display the results in a user-friendly web interface, facilitating blockchain-based interactions.
## Getting Started

### Executing program

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
